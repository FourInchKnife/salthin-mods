Mod pack on Salthin’s private server. 

Make sure to install forge from 
[the official forge website](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.15.2.html "Minecraft Forge for 1.15.2")
and get at least version *31.2.36* (currently the latest version, not the recommended one)

Once you download and run the forge installer, set the version in the launcher
to forge 1.15.2 and run the game. After the first run,
close the game and put the mods folder into your `.minecraft`
folder. In-depth instructions [here](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mods/Forge#Forge_Modifications "Minecraft Gamepedia guide to modding").
